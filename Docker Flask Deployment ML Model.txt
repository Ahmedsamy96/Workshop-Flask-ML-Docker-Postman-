At first you have to know very well about ML , Flask , and Docker...

Steps of the project :

1- create breast_canser folder and stand on it using anaconda prompt : 
   cd C:\Users\SAMY\Desktop\Workshop\Model_Deployment\Breast_canser

2- create new environment for this project : 
          conda create -n breast_cancer python=3.7
then activate this environment :
          conda activate breast_cancer

3- from the same prompt : pip install pandas , fsspec, sklearn , seaborn , matplotlib , and jupyter notebook

4- a- open jupyter notebook from the prompt.
   b- read csv file (for breast cancer).
   c- Create my ML Model.
   d- Save the model as pkl file 
   e- create a new test notebook to use the saved model on a dataset with the same cols and state of breast cancer to predict one given value .
   
6- Go to (Deploy folder)  , Create app.py for flask   and Dockerfile for Docker Deployment

7- in app.py we need to get data from POST method so using simple application (postman) take a json block return it as a df row to apply the pkl model on it from the app.py file and run all of this as a webservice using flask.
   Note : Copy pkl file to (Deploy folder)

8- from prompt (cd Deploy) then, create python env :
    (conda create -n Deploy python=3.7)
    (conda activate Deploy)
    ( pip install pandas sklearn flask fsspec )
then run app.py :
    ( python app.py )

9- To save all requirements for Dockder :
      from prompt staning in Deploy use : 
             ( pip freeze > requirements.txt)
 then : ( pip install -r requirements.txt )

10- open file ( Dockerfile ) and make it read requirements.txt
11- open Docker Desktop 
12- from Deploy on prompt create image : 
    ( docker build -t breast_cancer_class:1.0 . )
     (docker run -p 5000:3000 breast_cancer_class:1.0 )


>> docker ps -a (to give a list of all running Containers)
>> docker images (to give a list of all images)
>> docker rm -f edfa54
